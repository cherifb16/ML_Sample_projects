At the end of the test they also were given the option to complete a short research survey. This datatset comes from those who agreed to complete the research survey and answered yes to the question \"Have you given accurate answers and may they be used for research?\" at the end.\n\nThis data was collected 2017 - 2019.\n\nThe following items were included in the survey:\n\nQ1\tI found myself getting upset by quite trivial things.\nQ2\tI was aware of dryness of my mouth.\nQ3\tI couldn't seem to experience any positive feeling at all.\nQ4\tI experienced breathing difficulty (eg, excessively rapid breathing, breathlessness in the absence of physical exertion).\nQ5\tI just couldn&#39;t seem to get going.\nQ6\tI tended to over-react to situations.\nQ7\tI had a feeling of shakiness (eg, legs going to give way).\nQ8\tI found it difficult to relax.\nQ9\tI found myself in situations that made me so anxious I was most relieved when they ended.\nQ10\tI felt that I had nothing to look forward to.\nQ11\tI found myself getting upset rather easily.\nQ12\tI felt that I was using a lot of nervous energy.\nQ13\tI felt sad and depressed.\nQ14\tI found myself getting impatient when I was delayed in any way (eg, elevators, traffic lights, being kept waiting).\nQ15\tI had a feeling of faintness.\nQ16\tI felt that I had lost interest in just about everything.\nQ17\tI felt I wasn&#39;t worth much as a person.\nQ18\tI felt that I was rather touchy.\nQ19\tI perspired noticeably (eg, hands sweaty) in the absence of high temperatures or physical exertion.\nQ20\tI felt scared without any good reason.\nQ21\tI felt that life wasn&#39;t worthwhile.\nQ22\tI found it hard to wind down.\nQ23\tI had difficulty in swallowing.\nQ24\tI couldn&#39;t seem to get any enjoyment out of the things I did.\nQ25\tI was aware of the action of my heart in the absence of physical exertion (eg, sense of heart rate increase, heart missing a beat).\nQ26\tI felt down-hearted and blue.\nQ27\tI found that I was very irritable.\nQ28\tI felt I was close to panic.\nQ29\tI found it hard to calm down after something upset me.\nQ30\tI feared that I would be &quot;thrown&quot; by some trivial but unfamiliar task.\nQ31\tI was unable to become enthusiastic about anything.\nQ32\tI found it difficult to tolerate interruptions to what I was doing.\nQ33\tI was in a state of nervous tension.\nQ34\tI felt I was pretty worthless.\nQ35\tI was intolerant of anything that kept me from getting on with what I was doing.\nQ36\tI felt terrified.\nQ37\tI could see nothing in the future to be hopeful about.\nQ38\tI felt that life was meaningless.\nQ39\tI found myself getting agitated.\nQ40\tI was worried about situations in which I might panic and make a fool of myself.\nQ41\tI experienced trembling (eg, in the hands).\nQ42\tI found it difficult to work up the initiative to do things.\n\nEach item was presented one at a time in a random order for each new participant along with a 4 point rating scale asking the user to indicate how often that had been true of them in the past week where\n\n1 = Did not apply to me at all \n2 = Applied to me to some degree, or some of the time\n3 = Applied to me to a considerable degree, or a good part of the time\n4 = Applied to me very much, or most of the time\n\n(see the file demo1.png for how this looked)\n\nThis response is stored in variable A (e.g. Q1A). Also recorded was the time taken in milliseconds to answer that question (E) and that question's position in the survey (I).\n\nThese other durations were also recorded (measured on the server's side):\n\nintroelapse\t\tThe time spent on the introduction/landing page (in seconds)\ntestelapse\t\tThe time spent on all the DASS questions (should be equivalent to the time elapsed on all the indiviudal questions combined)\nsurveyelapse\tThe time spent answering the rest of the demographic and survey questions\n\nOn the next page was a generic demographics survey with many different questions.\n\nThe Ten Item Personality Inventory was administered (see Gosling, S.
